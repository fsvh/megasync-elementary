#megasync-elementary
This script replaces the inconsistent (and awful) MEGAsync tray icons with elementary-styled monochrome icons by installing a patched verison of sni-qt!

#Usage

    cd
    git clone https://github.com/cybre/megasync-elementary.git
    cd megasync-elementary
    sudo ./install.sh

#Note
This script is based on "skype-wrapper".
